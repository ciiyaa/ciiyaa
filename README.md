# Hi ♥, this is Ava || Eva

_“That brain of mine is something more than merely
mortal, as time will show.”_
— Ada Lovelace

This is a space where _Ava_, the logical problem-solver,
and _Eva_, the empathetic visionary, come together to create,
innovate, and inspire. I’m a computer science graduate and tech
enthusiast with a background spanning programming, sales,
training in challenging environments, and managing operations
in dynamic settings
all with a commitment to making technology work *for good.*

## What I Bring to the Table  

- **Tech for Impact:** Experience delivering tech solutions in underserved and
  diverse communities, with international NGOs.  
- **Leadership:** Managed centers and training initiatives, bridging
  cultural gaps and fostering teamwork.  
- **Problem-Solving:** From debugging code to optimizing operations,
  I thrive on finding creative, efficient solutions.

## Current Focus  

- Exploring how technology can enhance workflows, empower teams, and create
  lasting impact.  
- Collaborating on meaningful projects that combine tech and social good.  
- Launching a humanitarian tech program to empower vulnerable communities,
  focusing on mentorship and sustainable growth.

## Why I’m Here  

This GitHub is more than a repository—it’s a showcase of how tech and purpose
intersect. Whether you’re here for code, collaboration, or just curiosity,
I hope you’ll find something inspiring.
